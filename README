gir2gapi - Converter to produce GAPI XML files from gir files.

This project hopes to take advantage of the gobject-introspection
integration into Gnome libraries to replace the GAPI parsing of 
C sources.  The idea is to produce a converter to produce GAPI
api.xml files from a gir definition of the API, and then consume
this output in the existing generation tools.  It will amount to
a proprocessing step but one that should eliminate parsing
headaches and hopefully result in less manual intervention
into the binding production.
