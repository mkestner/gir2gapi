Conversion tool to produce Gapi XML files from gir files.

Description:
------------

This project hopes to take advantage of the gobject-introspection
scanning of Gnome libraries to replace the GAPI parser.  The goal 
is to produce Gapi XML files from a gir definition of the API, and then consume
this output in the existing generation tools.  It will amount to
a preprocessing step but one that should eliminate parsing
headaches and hopefully result in less manual intervention
and markup in binding preparation.


Build:
------

On mono, invoke xbuild in the project root dir, or open gapi2gir.sln
with MonoDevelop.  The project can also be build with Visual C# or 
Visual Studio on windows, or using msbuild without the IDE.


Usage:
------

gapi2gir --gir=path/to/foo.gir --out=path/to/gapi.xml

The tool is designed to spew warnings when it detects attributes or 
child elements it does not expect.  Some of these will probably be
unuseful.  We intentionally ignore many of the attributes in gir.  If
you encounter any warnings, feel free to forward them to the project
maintainer for investigation, particularly if it appears to be useful
information being ignored.
